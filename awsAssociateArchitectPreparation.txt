IAM
allows to manage users

centralized control of aws exam
shared access to ur aws account
allows multi factor authentication
temporary access to users when necessary
allows to setup own password policy

Users
end users (people) 

Groups
a collection of users under one set of permissions

Roles
assign roles and assign them to aws resources

policies
a doc that defines 1/more permissions

Quiz

IAM
IAM allows you to manage users, groups, roles and 
their corresponding level of access to AWS platform

IAM
centralised control of your aws account
integrates with existing active directory account allowing single sign on
fine grained access control to aws resources
the ability to create user/group/roles
allows you to set up your own password protection policy

Power user access allows
access to all aws services except for mgt of groups and users within IAM

root account
administrator access

Users and policy regions are global

very first thing
set up an account using their company email address

You are a security administrator working for a hotel chain. You have a new member of staff who has started as a systems administrator and they will need full access to the AWS console. You have created the user account and generated the access key id and the secret access key. You have moved this user into the group where the other administrators are and you have provided the new user with their secret access key and their access key id. However when they go to log in to the AWS console, they cannot sign in. What could be the cause of this?
-cannot log into console using access id and secret key, instead u must generate a password for the user and supply this user with the password as well as unique link

additional way to secure IAM for both the root login and new users alike
-multi factor authentication

by default when new user is created
no accesss to all aws services

policy docs are written in
json

S3 - 101

simple storage service
durable, highly scalable object storage
object based storage (fa)
data is spread across multiple devices and facilities
can't install os or db

S3
object based allows u to upload files
0 - 5 tb objects
unlimited storage
files are stored in buckets
s3 is universal namespace, unique globally

Data consistency model for s3

Read after write consistency for puts of new objects
eventual consistency for overwrite puts and deletes (can take some time to propagate)

s3 - is a simple key value storage
key		fileName
value		file
version id	
meta data	data about metadata - Eg:when created
subresources 	Access control lists
		torrent		

99.99	2  9 availabity		 same for all
	11 9 durability gurantee	11 9		2 9

tiered storage available
lifecycle mgt
version
encrypting 

s3 - storage class tier
S3 std- 
S3 IA - infrequent access
s3 reduced redundancy storage

Glacier
very cheap
used for archival only
3-5 hours to restore from glacier

s3 charges
charged for 
storage
requests
storage mgt pricing
data transfer pricing - coming in free, moving out charged

transfer acceleration - 
it enable fast easy and secure transfer of files over long distances between ur end users and s3 bucket.
takes advantage of CloudFront's globally distributed edge locations
as the data arrives at an edge location, data is routed to s3 over optimized network path

upto 37% faster
 
read after write consistency for puts of new objects
eventual consistency for overwrite puts and deletes (can take some time to propogate)

--------tips

s3 storage classes/tiers
S3 - 	durable, immediately available, frequently accessed
s3 IA - durable, immediately available, infrequently accessed
s3 reduced redundancy storage - data that is easily reproducable, eg: thumbnail
Glacier - archived data - u can wait 3-5 hours b4 accessing

core fundamentals of s3
key 
value
version
metadata
subresources - exists underneath the object
	acl - access conrol list	
	torrent - support for 

upload 200 status

Delete object
delete all versions
delete delete marker

s3 versioning not always useful

MFA delete

--s3 versioning exam tips

stores all versions of an object (including all writes and even if you delete an object)
great back up tool
once enabled versioning cannot be disabled, only suspended
integrates with lifecycle rules
versioning mfa's delete capability, which uses multi factor authentication
can be used to provide an additional layer of security

Source- select the replica bucket
Destination - select iam role

only new ones go to replica

source bucket 	- 	destination bucket

when u delete an object from a source bucket creates a delete marker
and creates a delete market in destination bucket as well

when u delete the delete market from source bucket 
it doesn't delete the delete market from destination bucket

S3 - cross region replication exam tips

versioning must be enabled on both the source and destination buckets
regions must be unique
files in an existing bucket are not replicated automatically.
all subsequent updated files will be replicated automatically
you cannot replicate to multiple buckets or use daisy chaining (at this time)
delete markers are replicated
deleting individual versions or delete markers will not be replicated
understand what cross region replication is at a high level

Life cycle mgt , s3-IA & Glacier lab
automate transition to tiered storage

s3 -> s3-IA -> glacier

s3 -> mgt -> Add lifecycle rule
name -> configure transistion -> 

current version -> add transisistion
to IA after 30 days
to Glacier after 60 days

previous version -> to IA -> to Glacier

configure expiration
save

------

lifecycle mgt - exam tips

can be used in conjunction with versioning 
can be applied to current and previous versions
following actions can now be done
 transition to the std - infrequent access storage class
	128 kb and 30 days after the creation date
archive to glacier storage class 
	30 days after ia - if relevant
permanantly delete

Cloud Front 
CDN - content delivery network 

it's a system of distributed servers(network) that deliver webpages and other web content to a user based on the geographic locations of the user.
the origin of the webpage and a content delivery server.

edge location 
is the location where content will be cached
this is seperate to an aws region/az

origin
this is the origin of all the files that the cdn will distribute.
this can be either an 
s3 bucket, an ec2 instance, an elastic load balancer or route 53.

distribution - cdn
collection of edge locations

edge locations over 50 of them currently

ttl
time to live

not quicker for the 1st user/ 1st time, but for the 2nd time it's faster

amazon cloud front can be used to deliver ur entire website
including dynamic, static and streaming and interactive content using a globale network of edge locations.
requests for your content are automatically routed to the nearest edge location.
so content is delivered with the best possible performance


amz cloudfront is optimized to work with any other amz web services
like s3, elastic compute cloud, elastic load balancing and amazon route 53.
amz cloud front also works seamlessly with any non-aws origin server which stores the original definitive versions of ur files.

Cloud Front - Key Terminology

Web Distribution - Typically used for websites
RTMP - used for media streaming

--cloud front exam tips

edge location - this is the location where content will be cached.
this is seperate to an aws region/az

origin - this is the origin of all the files that the cdn will distribute. this can be either an s3, ec2 or elastic load balancer or Route 53.

Distribution - this is the name given to the cdn which consists of a collection of edge locations.

web distribution - typically used for websites
	Web - for websites
	RTMP - for media streaming 

edge locations are not just for read only, you can write to them too.
(put an object to them)

objects are cached for the life of the TTL (time to live)

you can clear cached objects, but you will be charged.
