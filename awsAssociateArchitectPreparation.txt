IAM
allows to manage users

centralized control of aws exam
shared access to ur aws account
allows multi factor authentication
temporary access to users when necessary
allows to setup own password policy

Users
end users (people) 

Groups
a collection of users under one set of permissions

Roles
assign roles and assign them to aws resources

policies
a doc that defines 1/more permissions

IAM consists
Users 
Groups
Roles
Policy Documents		Effect Action Resource

IAM is universal, doen't apply region at this time
root account - full admin 
new users have no permissions when created
aws console - username, password
api programmatically - access key id, secret access key

Quiz

IAM
IAM allows you to manage users, groups, roles and 
their corresponding level of access to AWS platform

IAM
centralised control of your aws account
integrates with existing active directory account allowing single sign on
fine grained access control to aws resources
the ability to create user/group/roles
allows you to set up your own password protection policy

Power user access allows
access to all aws services except for mgt of groups and users within IAM

root account
administrator access

Users and policy regions are global

very first thing
set up an account using their company email address

You are a security administrator working for a hotel chain. You have a new member of staff who has started as a systems administrator and they will need full access to the AWS console. You have created the user account and generated the access key id and the secret access key. You have moved this user into the group where the other administrators are and you have provided the new user with their secret access key and their access key id. However when they go to log in to the AWS console, they cannot sign in. What could be the cause of this?
-cannot log into console using access id and secret key, instead u must generate a password for the user and supply this user with the password as well as unique link

additional way to secure IAM for both the root login and new users alike
-multi factor authentication

by default when new user is created
no accesss to all aws services

policy docs are written in
json

S3 - 101

simple storage service
durable, highly scalable object storage
object based storage (fa)
data is spread across multiple devices and facilities
can't install os or db

S3
object based allows u to upload files
0 - 5 tb objects
unlimited storage
files are stored in buckets
s3 is universal namespace, unique globally

Data consistency model for s3

Read after write consistency for puts of new objects
eventual consistency for overwrite puts and deletes (can take some time to propagate)

s3 - is a simple key value storage
key		fileName
value		file
version id	
meta data	data about metadata - Eg:when created
subresources 	Access control lists
		torrent		

99.99	2  9 availabity		 same for all
	11 9 durability gurantee	11 9		2 9

tiered storage available
lifecycle mgt
version
encrypting 

s3 - storage class tier
S3 std- 
S3 IA - infrequent access
s3 reduced redundancy storage

Glacier
very cheap
used for archival only
3-5 hours to restore from glacier

s3 charges
charged for 
storage
requests
storage mgt pricing
data transfer pricing - coming in free, moving out charged

transfer acceleration - 
it enable fast easy and secure transfer of files over long distances between ur end users and s3 bucket.
takes advantage of CloudFront's globally distributed edge locations
as the data arrives at an edge location, data is routed to s3 over optimized network path

upto 37% faster
 
read after write consistency for puts of new objects
eventual consistency for overwrite puts and deletes (can take some time to propogate)

--------tips

s3 storage classes/tiers
S3 - 	durable, immediately available, frequently accessed
s3 IA - durable, immediately available, infrequently accessed
s3 reduced redundancy storage - data that is easily reproducable, eg: thumbnail
Glacier - archived data - u can wait 3-5 hours b4 accessing

core fundamentals of s3
key 
value
version
metadata
subresources - exists underneath the object
	acl - access conrol list	
	torrent - support for 

upload 200 status
